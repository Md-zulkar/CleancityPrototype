EcoBin — AI-Powered Smart Waste Management (prototype)

Overview
A single-page prototype demonstrating an AI-powered smart waste management UI (QR scanning, waste categories, rewards, municipal dashboard mockups).

Highlights
- Static prototype: index.html (contains UI, inline CSS and JS)
- QR scanner using qr-scanner.umd.min.js
- Azure deploy workflow included (.github/workflows/azure-webapps-node.yml)

Quickstart (local)
1. Clone the repo:
   git clone https://github.com/Md-zulkar/CleancityPrototype.git
2. Open the prototype:
   - Open `index.html` in a modern browser (Chrome/Edge) to try the UI and QR scanner.
   - For camera features use a secure context (localhost or HTTPS).

Roadmap / Next improvements
- Extract inline CSS/JS into /assets for maintainability
- Add automated CI: linting and accessibility checks
- Add tests and a demo deployment (GitHub Pages or Azure)
